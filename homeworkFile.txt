One-Punch Man originates the story of Saitama, a hero for fun. The ‘final’ hero, in a sense. Author ‘One’ builds out a fantastical world of high-powered and flamboyant heroes and monsters doing battle in uniformly destructible cities, alphabetically signified for simplicity sake.

Overwhelming strength is … boring. Because of course it is. Saitama, or “Caped Baldy” as he comes to be known to the Hero Association, and his unstoppable combat ability afford him victory against every opponent he faces. But it happens instantly, without any strategic analyses or physical rigor, without any semblance of potential failure. Every battle is decided before it’s begun, because he is already the best. Naturally, he feels nothing approaching thrill or joy or gratification during the course of his work as a hero.
